# AI-Society-S7
This is a personal project, it involves developing an AI model trained to predict top hit songs. New artists can use this AI tool as a guide on how to improve their songs and increase their chances of reaching the top charts. However, the AI model serves as a recommendation tool rather than providing a guaranteed formula for success.

This project involves building the model and considering the impact it may have on society.

The "Top Hit Songs" folder contains a Jupyter Notebook and a proof-of-concept web app for the model. The Jupyter Notebook documents the process of cleaning the data, visualizing it, training a model, and saving the model to be used in the web app.

The web app is simpleâ€”it consists of a main.py file and an index.html file. To run the backend, use the main.py file with the Uvicorn library. For the frontend, open index.html using the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.
