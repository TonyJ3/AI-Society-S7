# AI-Society-S7
This is a personal project, it involves developing an AI model trained to predict top hit songs. New artists can use this AI tool as a guide on how to improve their songs and increase their chances of reaching the top charts. However, the AI model serves as a recommendation tool rather than providing a guaranteed formula for success.

This project involves building the model and considering the impact it may have on society.
